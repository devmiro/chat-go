1. **cmd Folder**:
   - `chatserver`: The main entry point for your chat server application.
   - `chatbot`: The entry point for your chat bot application.

2. **internal Folder**:
   - `chat`: Handles chat-related functionality, including message handling and storage.
   - `user`: Manages user-related functionality, such as user registration and login.
   - `bot`: Contains the logic for the chat bot, including API interactions.
   - `stock`: Handles stock-related functionality, including API calls and data parsing.
   - `message`: Defines the structure of chat messages and handles their processing.
   - `database.go`: Provides database connectivity and interaction methods.

3. **web Folder**:
   - `static/css`: Contains your application's stylesheet.
   - `static/js`: Houses your application's JavaScript code.
   - `templates`: Stores HTML templates for rendering web pages.
   - `server.go`: Sets up and configures your web server.

4. **README.md**: This file should contain documentation and instructions for running and using your chat application.

5. **go.mod and go.sum**: These files manage your project's dependencies.

Key components:

- `main.go` in `cmd/chatserver`: This is where your chat server is initialized. It should handle user authentication, chat room creation, and message routing.

- `main.go` in `cmd/chatbot`: This is where your chat bot is initialized. It should handle stock-related commands, API calls, and message posting.

- `chat.go` in `internal/chat`: Implement chat-related functionality, including message handling and storage. Ensure that messages are ordered by timestamps and that only the last 50 messages are displayed.

- `user.go` in `internal/user`: Implement user registration and login functionality.

- `bot.go` in `internal/bot`: Create a decoupled bot that interacts with the stock API and posts messages to the chat room.

- `stock.go` in `internal/stock`: Handle stock-related functionality, including API calls and CSV parsing.

- `message.go` in `internal/message`: Define the structure of chat messages and handle their processing.

- `server.go` in `web`: Set up your web server, handle WebSocket connections for real-time chat, and serve static files and HTML templates.

The `requirements.txt` file lists the required Go packages and libraries you'll need to import using `go get` to set up your project.

You can start by implementing these components and gradually building the features outlined in the project description. I follow best practices for code organization, testing, and documentation as you work on this Go chat application.
